Major API changes. Bump stage to 2.

`mapRemoved`, `Refs`, `Ref`, `unmount`, `refs`, `getChangedItems`, `getAddedItems` and `getRemovedItems` has been removed.

Add `getResolvedElements`, `resolveElements`, `getFirstChild` and `resolveFirst` primitives.

Improve `mergeRefs` to allow an array of refs to be passed in.
